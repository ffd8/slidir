# slidir

slides within dirs.  

Tool for presenting diverse media per student based on folder structure. Just drop images/movies into a folder for each student, then it will build a repeating slideshow of that content, timed per folder.

This was created for our BA Thesis Workshop at [The Basel School of Design](http://thebaselschoolofdesign.ch) when kicking off the design process and quickly generating images to explain ones topic.

## Usage
- Download/clone and run on local server (MAMP)
- Edit index.html PREFS for timing between folders and slides.
- Create/copy folders into the `/media` directory as you want presented (alphabetically sorted).
- Add media to each folder [ jpg | gif | png | mp4 | mov ]
- Load page, press SPACEBAR to begin slideshow.
- After 5min (default), will auto swap to next directory.
- Use Arrow Keys to manually go faster, repeat.
- URL hash changes to current step, so you can pause and continue at any time.
- Press 'b', to show the break slide.
